2023-May-11 15:35:30.729560 Assembly begins.
Command line:
shasta --input /mnt/d/HGT/time_lines//tmp.fasta --config Nanopore-May2022 
For options in use for this assembly, see shasta.conf in the assembly directory.
This run uses options "--memoryBacking 4K --memoryMode anonymous".
This could result in performance degradation.
For full performance, use "--memoryBacking 2M --memoryMode filesystem"
(root privilege via sudo required).
Therefore the results of this run should not be used
for benchmarking purposes.
This assembly will use 20 threads.

This run used options "--memoryBacking 4K --memoryMode anonymous".
This could have resulted in performance degradation.
For full performance, use "--memoryBacking 2M --memoryMode filesystem"
(root privilege via sudo required).
Therefore the results of this run should not be used
for benchmarking purposes.
